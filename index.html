            Hello, people of the internet! It is I, an unknown person in the wide universe that is the world wide web. Though i dont know how you could ever find my puny website that I simply created for class, you might as well learn some stuff about me. 
          </p>
          <p>
           As almost everyone on the Internet that isn't popular in real life, I'm a fandom nerd. If I were to name every fandom I did the "dying fish mode" for, well, this website would be a lot bigger, but I'll try. Let's see...I am a demigod, Pokemn trainer, artist, wizard, bender, Phandom nerd, lamp, gamer, otaku, etc. On this website, I will rant about my life. This is my new blog among others I made for class. I will also TRY to post drawings of various characters. The picture on the left is a drawing of Asuna from Sword Art Online by me.
